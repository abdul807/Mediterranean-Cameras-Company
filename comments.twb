Even though iPhone 11 is here, it has the same exact screen and almost the same features except the camera. If you are a die hard camera fan, then go for iPhone 11.

              <bucket>&quot;Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I purchased this beauty in big billion sale. Thus I got it at a remarkable price. The battery life is good so far and the speed has been pretty good. I love the overall look, size and design of this model a lot. The camera quality is great but definitely the higher version have a better camera quality experience to provide.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I upgraded from iphone 5 to Xr, and there is a huge difference in battery. According to my mobile usage, I used to charge iPhone 5 thrice a day and Now, I charge my Xr once in 3 days. The difference is immense.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I was more satisfied with my one plus 6T than this. Picture customization is not better than that phone. Without comparison it&apos;s ok. Battery life is good than other iPhones and the app size in store is very less compared to play store so even with 64 gb it&apos;s good.&quot;</bucket>

Apple says it is the duty of amazon to take measures for replacement. Still left nowhere with my money gone on a damaged product.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Overall Iphone XR is far better than X and other predecessors. Processor is way fast than others, build quality is awesome ,face recognition is too quick and the feel which you get by holding it is superlike. One suggestion to Apple that they must include fingerprint sensors too for more effective security.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;A lot of criticism of iPhone XR has been about its inability to take portrait pics of ƒ??only human faces!ƒ? Though true, it can be very easily overcome by downloading a software app - ƒ??Halide!ƒ? That and the near negligible difference in viewing experience, puts it on par with iPhone XS and even XS Max! Just go for itƒ?? the 256 GB storage version!&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Device was heating too much after just a little bit of graphic works on that. Camera was too bad , front camera is no where matching the quality of IOS. I was totally disappointed with that device , I think they sold me the defective peice in the name of sale on your platform. This kind of professionalism is not good . I believe too much on Amazon but later on that I am not giving any bulk amount of order on this e commerce platform. Sorry for the comments if it hurts anyone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn&apos;t have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don&apos;t show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can&apos;t solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if u can.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Dude i was confused first that which one i should buy oneplus 7pro or iphone xr, so i choosen xr for 40k on offer and every thing ia good but i am dissapointed with tha camera quality and display quality really i have iphone 7plus also but the display is far far better then xr and the camera is also better but i know iphone 7plus has dual camera and that&apos;s ok but dude detailing is missing and also zooming is also missing we get digital zoom which reduces tha quality....&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;One of the best purchase from Amazon. Packing and Delivery is good uncomparable. The phone and it&apos;s performance are satisfying. 12 days usage of the phone left me without a complaint. I give 5 ???? to this purchase.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and thereƒ??s a glitch in the front cameraƒ??s portrait mode. Thatƒ??s fine, it may happen. But whatƒ??s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!&quot;</bucket>

            <map to='#59a14f'>
              <bucket>&quot;This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This is my first iPhone after 10 years of being an android user. This review is after using this phone for 2 months. The performance has been top notch, battery life is very good considering  most of my days are moderate to heavy usage I still find 20-30 \% battery the next day. Camera is good too but at time you miss the secondary lens for portraits and portraits donƒ??t work on objects.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I always thought to buy iPhone and every time I used to think that what is so special in iPhone but yes after buying iPhone XR I can say that no one can replace this. Starting from battery life to the screen which is standard and can be used one handed. Camera quality is also very good which you can realise after two three clicks only. So for me iPhone XR is a beast at low price among other iPhone models.&quot;</bucket>

            <map to='#79706e'>
              <bucket>&quot;I got iphoneXR at very reasonable price. The apple company has made one thing better in this model i.e. battery life. The phone runs for 2days with full charge. there is no finger print reader in this model although face id is very accurate, it scans your face even in the dark. There is no doubt about the picture quality when it comes to iphone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;iPhone XR is still a great buy. The price VS performance ratio on this phone makes it a very sensible buy. If you donƒ??t care about the latest and greatest this one year old offering from Apple is a far better buy. Only down side on the phone are as follows:-&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;It is my red beast.... My first iPhone experience with iPhone xr is very smooth and awesome... I got is at only 38K many many thanks to amazon for this. Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup u can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer). With your saved money u can buy different apple accessories. Overall my first iPhone experience is awesome.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Fingerprint reader given one star coz it has Face ID ????, it works lightning fast (even in the dark) , super build quality, battery backup is nuts (works for more than 2 days with decent use) , Camera quality is amazing for photography and videography. Preferred product over iphone X if screen quality is not the main thing to notice (doesn&apos;t matter if you don&apos;t watch 4K videos on youtube)&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I just loved it and I think the only thing that is lagging in this product which is the oled screen is not an issue at all , the quality of the lcd is way too good and as long as you are not too obsessed with every feature to be the latest and best , go for it , plus now they are offering at a way better price , definitely worth it&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Its a perfect phone, though a bit heavy coz of the metal body. I got this in red colour which is my favourite and its such a settled red, basically its a mixture of red and maroon. Camera quality is also good not the best as compare to other apple phones. Overall i love my phone as its a gift from my darling husband.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Upgrading from iPhone 6 (16GB) to iPhone XR (128) was the best decision I ever made. Everything is so perfect &amp; optimize. Touch, display, camera, sound, processor, battery.. literally everything.  Apple needs to work on their latest iOS 13 though. (Also Iƒ??m getting more kills on PUGB:) Hands down to A12 Bionic.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Was sceptical at first. But after I received the phone itƒ??s good and in mint condition. I am upgrading from iPhone 7 and itƒ??s worth it. My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing! Face recognition is like butter. (Donƒ??t know what will happen in the future) best part upgrading is the screen  size. Totally worth it. Videos are a bit dull but for the cost itƒ??s worth it!! Thank you amazon for not sending a duplicate phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Purchased the 128 GB version during the freedom sale for 57k. I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;?ÿI chose iPhone XR over x. The reasons are, it is 6.1-inch display and supports dual sim. the Battery Durability longs last. I got the Brand New peace (made in 2019, September) without any defect.&quot;</bucket>

Camera has been the best...not as good as of Samsung s series and note series  but for me its the best...face recognition works like charm...&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Awesome product !! Far better than spending almost double for Xs, XS MAX, 11 as the difference is only display and camera. Otherwise everything is same. It would be definitely a bigger upgrade if anyone is switching from iphone 8 or 8+ to it. The entire UI is different. Icing on the cake is the PRIVACY, its the utmost priority of Apple it seems. Without you face id, nobody can see even the notifications. Its a must buy product.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Battery quality is worst I have honor 8c and it gives 2 days backup and this phone last only 12 hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional 3 hours for full charging if u want to waste your money then go for it if u r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better  configurations that too almost half of its price&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone online&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I&apos;ve been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It&apos;s been more than one month since I got this phone and I&apos;m loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I&apos;m using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Iƒ??m an Apple fan, because of its simplicity, elegance &amp; good camera. In addition, this phone has a longer battery life, even with good internet use. May be the price could be little more competitive, but all in all, a nice phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;It&apos;s a very pretty and good looking mobile. Performance wise, it is super smooth. Camera is as good as iPhone XS, portrait mode is also good enough.  And the best part is, being an iphone it has a long lasting battery. Though it has LCD, but you would hardly be able to find any difference between this and OLED. Size is perfect, infact everything is perfect and cool!&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Needless to rate Apple any less. An year old Appleƒ??s A12 bionic still outperforms SD 855. And iOS, such a beautiful liquid smooth OS that Android can never compete.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Serious problem with the lower mic, after spending all that money in this faulty crap just after two months you finally feel that you are the biggest C* in India who is buying an iPhone. Fragile product, connectivity issue, software issue &amp; restrictions  all the type of minor issues have been build up causing a serious issue. Think before you waste ya hard earned money. Apple products are degrading their quality to keep their stocks and shares up.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Easy to use, serves the purpose. I was an android guy for like last 7 years before that was using blackberry in between switched to ios as i used iphone 5c but at that time i was a bit disappointed may be because quite young i was and a bit techie but now i use my phone for basic purposes like calls, whats app, email, social media n bit gaming n music so it really handles that well though i was a bit hesitant at first as i was used to of finger touch sensor but seriously face recognition is damn good it works like a charm even when there is no light, so if you want no nonsense stuff n if it suits your requirements then go for it as now a days even droids are equally expensive in-fact some are more expensive like fold, razr etc. so just listen to your heart and buy ios or android and you wont go wrong, though i got mine in an offer for ƒ??43000 for 128 GB variant&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Great phone. Not a gamer so donƒ??t care about the hardware stuff. Not a pro photographer so any pictures I shoot are epic for me. Not a loud person, so speakers on low volume for me work just perfectly. Battery life should be great like most apple phones do. Display is soft to my eyes so I like that. Apple interface is the best, so nothing much to say about there.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies arenƒ??t good at all. You canƒ??t even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records thatƒ??s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I have been using this Phone for about 5 months. I had used 5s and 6s plus. This phone is definitely a Big Big upgrade from former models. Itƒ??s brilliant in every possible way. The two main concerns which I had earlier with iPhones were battery life and secondary SIM card. Iƒ??m happy that finally Apple heard us and released this beast. You might wonder about thick bezels and LCD display on this phone. I bet you donƒ??t notice them at all when you get along with this phone. No wonder why XR is the best selling smartphone worldwide. Battery life is excellent. Enough of reviews. Just go for it. You wonƒ??t regret at any point of time!&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The most positive aspect of XR is battery life in my usage of 6 months. Downside is weight especially if you are upgrading from iPhone 6 or 7.

            <map to='#9d7660'>
              <bucket>&quot;What do I say about it. Night vision of camera is not at all good. Battery literally gets drain if we use mobile data for longer time. Yes but I have to admit if we do not use mobile data or wifi battery life is longer. Face recognition is not as fast as I was thinking compare to other brands with same features. But I loved my iPhone regardless of all this little issues.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn&apos;t working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor. My city (Imphal) apple servicing centre doesn&apos;t allow me to take for servicing and tells me to go to Guwahati (Assam) for this problem. May be a coincidence because this problem happened when I used amazon basics 10w fast wireless charger which I combine with xiaomi quick charge 3&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you donƒ??t feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,ƒ?as you know glass is glass and glass will breakƒ?. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLEDƒ??s in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I am using apple from last 7 years. And never change apple phone frequently. I was using iPhone 6s from last 3 years but due to less space and batter backup, I need to upgrade it. I choose Apple iPhone because it&apos;s in between AppleXS and Apple X. Hardware A12 bionic chipset with 3 GB ram give my phone high speed on top of 128GB space thrilled the whole experience. In this new apple XR I still missed the center button especially when I play the games. Camera output is an amazing especially back camera. Also would like to appreciate the battery backup, I hardly change more than one time in 24hours. Now I do not need to my battery back always along with me ROFL.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Its been one week since i bought it. I am completely satisfied with the product. Screen is quite big. Only and only problem is with the Charger. It takes 3 hours to charge the phone to 100\%. Otherwise everything else is worth the price we are paying.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;My 1st iPhone. I liked it. Only difficulty I find is I didnƒ??t get much variety Of cases and cover for this model. You have to use for hands to handle this phone because of its size and skin. I purchased it in sell at Rs 46k in Nov 19. I prefer volume keys to be in right hand side and music aux cable on top which makes a mobile easy to handle and operate&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;need i say anything about this phone! it&apos;s a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you won&apos;t find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The best decision that I took was to give away my Samsung galaxy S8 and get this phone. I was skeptical at first considering on paper specs and the obvious inferior display. But I used it in a retail store and I didnƒ??t mind the display at all. It was one drawback that i could live with if i was getting everything much better than on the android side at the price range.&quot;</bucket>

Other than that battery life is around 1.5 days in normal usage and 6-8 hours in heavy games like pubg asphalt videos YouTube play music etc. at the price of 43k itƒ??s a steal....&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The phone is amazing but i got cheated as i was promised the EMI of 4040 per month for 12 months. The sum of rs 4275 got deducted from my account. This is seriously not fare as i m paying almost 1500 rs more for my phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;What is the main purpose of the Phone? To make and receive calls, right. This phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor. You have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you. All other feature works quite well. As for photos, even Poco F1 takes better pictures. Applez just a brand as was Nokia and Blackberry once.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Good phone. Great screen size. But apple still has not fixed low light shooting. It still looks like crap when compared to oppo or Samsung or the +one series. Itƒ??s incredible how we end up paying so much for an iPhone which still doesnƒ??t get its camera right. Battery life is good. Downside is the replacement of the phono jack for headphones with its lightning socket which operates both charger and headphones - which means you can only do one thing&quot;</bucket>

I was definitely expecting a better battery life in the normal mode. It&apos;s merely giving a day with normal usage in that mode. However, in the Low Power Mode, its giving a great battery life without compromising any regular features of the phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Thanks to amazon for giving it for great deal, iphone xr 128gb is absolutely fantastic, with good battery life, camera, and performance. Since 6 months waiting to upgrade from 6s, compare to 6s xr a bit bigger in screen size for me apart from that its a great device to use, thanks to the seller 3 years back got 6s from the same seller and it still works pretty well without any issues.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Don&apos;t buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn&apos;t change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. Itƒ??s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Donƒ??t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes itƒ??s expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. Thereƒ??s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phoneƒ??s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe itƒ??s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didnƒ??t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still donƒ??t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. Itƒ??s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didnƒ??t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;In my initial review, I said that the iPhone XR was the best iPhone for most people right, and my thoughts about it haven&apos;t changed six months later. This is still the best iPhone in the market, offering the same smooth and terrific user experience as the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max, but with the knowledge that you&apos;re also getting the best battery life. In fact, the battery life is at par, if not better, to what the P30 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ offer and that&apos;s saying something.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;It&apos;s an awesome product from Apple, The battery life has improved alot than the previously launched iPhone models. User interface and iOS 13.2 is excellent. Guys just go for it...&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;It&apos;s the latest offering from I phone. Simply great. Camera is superb. The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what&apos;s 1400 more to get the best&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;All the performance is good with all working features. and the main point was the battery backup of the phone it will minimun 1 and 1/2 day and another amazing think is i got no heating in this phone while i playing games like pubg mobile,cwc2 etc.Also a measure think is there is no comparison of ios with android. IOS is best in his performance.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I don&apos;t like the  features of iPhone XR after paying huge amount. It&apos;s battery is drained very fast . Side buttons are not comfortable while holding on hands, it pressed automatically without knowing . One-Two times it has automatically dialed the number when it was in my pocket. I think old version of iphones are  much better than this phone. I wants to return this phone but don&apos;t find any option in Amazon. Anyone please suggest how I can return it. I bought it 28 days before.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day); all original packing (phone box) and phone is working fine. Touchwood - no issues. The Deal was good with the 10\% additional HDFC discount. Go for 128 GB (or even higher) - the few extra thousand are worth it when you run out of space.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Just loving the XR and is super value for money. Camera quality is really good and screen size is just perfect for watching videos and doesnƒ??t look bulky at all. Only downside is that the Apple logo at the back on the black colour isnƒ??t visible to the naked eye so prominently. Best iPhone after the 6s model.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market.&quot;</bucket>

So if you want to disconnect or add another call, frst you have to wait for the screen to turn on.. which is very irritating. One canƒ??t even press the home button as it is not there in xr. Even aftr pressing power key, screen doesnƒ??t turn on immediately nd pressing it twice results in disconnection of call. ????????&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;6.1 inches screen for a phone is pretty good, feels heavy, but all that pales in comparison after the actual features of the phone are unlocked.I was informed that phone can be tracked even when switched off as per the new ios 13 update, camera quality is better , both front and back , fast charging too is great, i like the idea that the body is aluminium made as compared to the latest which after checking and reviewing holds up better after drop tests, face id recognition is great, but need back up in the form of app lock for unauthorized usage.Overall a great phone, at a amazing price, do not miss the chance to buy it, even if you feel it is heavy on your wallet, you wont get such a good phone loaded with features else where.Its like how the iphone 7 was the benchmark for future models , same goes for this phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Donƒ??t get swayed by some lame reviewers on YouTube. If u r holding out for an iPhone purchase then this is the real deal. The Xr is a jack of all trades although not excelling in any. The A12 Bionic is a beast,nƒ??uff said already, the stereo speakers sound sweet and battery life is great. I found the most bashed about lcd display very pragmatic for everyday use.The portrait shots taken with the camera look a stunner.With the reason price cut , this has turned out to be the VFM iPhone ever made&quot;</bucket>

Played WOW Blitz in 60FPS and found no issues. Will post the PUBG and Fortnite review in few days. Battery back up is about 6hrs screen on time for apps usage scenario.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I bought a iphone XR  ,Which has some screen and camera issues  ,screen is freezing ,Amazon custome r Care talk like we did mistake ,not gud behaviour called to amazon ,they asked to go Apple store,already visited there from apple support we got information battery already replaced of this IMIE number.I told them ,but they were not agree,they again and again saying go there,we cant replace it.we just requested also said we paid 50000 for that but they dont agree,so if you buying pn and you have any issue in phone even it would be damaged they are not going to replace IT,and this seller is selling refurbish product.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;If you are looking for an iPhone and your budget is around 50k-60k then you should definitely go with iPhone XR. It is the value for money iPhone. I&apos;ve been using it for the past 3 days and I am really happy with its performance.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;My second iphone and 3rd apple product so i can clearly say that if you are the first time user of apple product then you will surely give iphone XR 5 star rating but if you have been a long run user then you will think twice to give even 4 star also to this, may be after demise of Steve jobs apple has compromised with its quality, where as in till 2015 there were no comparison with any phone with iphone but now few products are giving strong comparison to it, apple is now only encashing its name but it will not good for the future of apple because now a days consumers are more aware, and if you are not giving 5 star to iphone the. Probably you have dealt with a wring product, sorry but not completely happy with XR. May be i will think next time when i will be upgrading my phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Not sure whether genuine product. Bought it on the first day of amazon sale. Within 15days, got a vertical line in the middle of display- see photos. Have bought 5 apple devices in the past and never had any problem with any of them so far. Since the return window closes within 19 days have to now take it to apple service center. Seriously makes me thing about the originality of the product.&quot;</bucket>

For anyone refraining from buying an iPhone because it has only a single SIM slot,  please be informed that this Phone does support Dual SIM if you use E-SIM. Airtel and Jio, for now, has E-SIM facility. For a more detailed review do visit my review website at excitedneurons(dot)com&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Best iPhone Iƒ??ve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this wouldƒ??ve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that!&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I have been using this phone for a while now. When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you wonƒ??t spot any difference with other iPhone displays.

Camera is good too and with dual sim capabilities the phone is sure a winner. The 11 is the same phone with just dual camera but 20k higher. So it didnƒ??t make sense to buy the iPhone 11.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Best value for money apple device right now got this iphone xr for 38k steal price totally worth it i am not an apple fanboy i use my oneplus 7 along with this device the softare smoothness is unmatchable camera is great and brand value is superb but main cons is slow charger it takes almost 3hr to complete the charge and display is also good but flat/accurate colours but i like the saturated one of my 1+ 7 but the quality is very nice closer to 1080 full hd panel for so under 45k is the best apple device you can get but if display is your main priority than oneplus 7t is a better overall device along with fast charging in this price range&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with itƒ??s great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, itƒ??s worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that itƒ??s an LCD screen but youƒ??ll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 oƒ??clock, i still had 66\% charge. Thatƒ??s what we needed in an iPhone.&quot;</bucket>

Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I got a very bad product from Amazon. This was really not expected from Amazon. i don&apos;t know whether its an issue from Apple or Amazon. From the day it has come it started giving me issues.Issues related Hardware like Distorted sound i.e. Other person cannot listen the voice clearly, voice becomes like mute, and Software Issues like Phone getting hanged [NEVER HEARD IOS HANGING], Not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call. I am the first time user to the iPhone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expected.I am really disappointed with the product.Also I think Battery Life can be improved. Camera quality and Face reader is OK.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10\% to 100\%. As I am used to iPhone home button, Iƒ??m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So itƒ??s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I purchased this phone (Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black) during the Amazone Deewali sale, working fine and no issues so far. Installation and configuration was pretty easy as my previous phone was also iphone. I have checked and verified the product and it is a genuine one. The convenience part  is copying contacts, photos , audio &amp; video files took less than 2 min. In overall,  phone is  good and i got it for around 50K with a Credit card refund offer of 2.5k back after 3 months. But I didnƒ??t receive the refund so far. Spoke to bank and they advised to get in touch with Amazon. Not sure where to reach now.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I upgraded from iPhone 6 which I had used for 2.5 years. For me iPhone XR seems super smooth with amazing speed. I am still getting used to the absence of Home button. Using the regular charger, the phone takes nearly 2 hours to fully charge but charge lasts for more than 1 day for my regular usage. Phone is slippery - so I have added a Spigen case as well. On the whole a good iphone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I was previously a user of iPhone SE and was wonderstruck with its abilities. But due to battery life had to look at a changeover. However looking at the price was little suspicious whether the phone would be worth for the money. Here are the pros n cons...&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and Iƒ??m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Nothing can beat iPhone. This is my fourth phone (iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 8 and now this) purchased from Amazon. All are excellent phones. Except for screen resolution, iPhone XR is nothing less than XS or XS Max. In fact, the battery life is twice as that of iPhone 8. Face recognition is excellent even in dark while android phones lack this technology. White is a beautiful color. Delivery was before scheduled deadline and in good external packing.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Used for a day as of now. Awesome phone. Snappy and fluid in use. battery backup is pretty good (around 8 hours of screen-on time) with continouse data-on (youtube 1.5 hrs). Using 18W adapter which charges it fast. Brought 3.5mm jack connector to lightening separately. Rest all good. Will review after few more days. Thanks.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device !&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and was confused about iPhone 11 &amp; iPhone XR. Decided to go for iPhone XR just from the cost perspective. Only from Camera and Processor POV there is an upgrade in iPhone 11 rest remains the same.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I&apos;ve been using this phone for almost a month a now and this is the fastest smartphone I&apos;ve ever used. I know this years iPhone 11 is faster than this but after watching a tons of comparison videos on YouTube I&apos;ve decided to go with the XR. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s worth the extra bucks and I&apos;m very satisfied with this purchase.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Phone not working. Phone was autotyping and then eventually frozen screen. I bought on 15th oct and barely used for few days. No support from amazon for replacement for defective piece. One thing to note that when I received this piece, it was in a locked bag. However, there should have been some QR code on bag which the delivery boy scans. There was no such code on the bag and the delivery center sent the qr code as whatsapp on my phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;An excellent phone. Does what you need at super speeds. Face ID is a charm. I think I got an excellent deal in the Dussehra sale. Only thing which has dumbfounded me is the colour. Looks orange on screen and more pinkish in real life. Solved using a Spigen black cover.  Should have gone for black.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Awesome phone, great battery life it can last upto 2 whole days, face ID works great even if you are in dark room. Screen size perfect so that we can do tasks using single hand. Will get long term support. 5w charging adapter works well but it&apos;s good to have 12w charger than 5w.&quot;</bucket>

            <map to='#f28e2b'>
              <bucket>&quot;Battery life will surely amaze the buyer, I use to charge my iPhone 7 Plus at the 100 percent to my office at 10AM  and while returning by 7 PM it used to be approx 7-8 percent remaining. I use my phone for basic tasks and PUBG during break. Now when XR came to my hand the very first day I forgot to charge my phone to 100 percent and took it to my office at 62 percent. Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break. It was my dream to have long lasting iOS enabled devices which came true with this spectacular device. One should blindly go for it if performance and battery is your huge concern.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I hot this product with 37K during big billion sale  ,and the product is super but it is not for you if you are a camera freak .

              <bucket>&quot;I still donƒ??t understand why people are crazy about iPhone. I bough this phone for 42k in great Indian sale couldnƒ??t find much difference so for. Itƒ??s been a week now. My old android is doing all the operation faster then this which detected my face quickly. And that has fingerprint support also. I am also crazy about this phone. My friend told that he will never go back to android again. Thatƒ??s the one reason for me to buy this phone. Let me wait for one more month to become addicted.  Till then Iƒ??ll leave the rating to 4*. When you think that this phone is expensive, thatƒ??s proving that this phone is for royal customers :p. Go for it if you are affordable.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I was a bit skeptical about buying it on Amazon. But happy to say..No regrets at all on this purchase. Works exactly as advertised. Absolutely no issues at all. Great battery life, nice photos. While the other variants of the latest iPhone have oled screen, this one has an lcd screen. But I don&apos;t think it is making a difference to me. The screen quality is excellent. Overall very satisfied with this purchase.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;It&apos;s one of the best phones available in the market right now. Apple always gives the best products to its customers. It had A12 chipset which can do 5 trillion operations per second. It never slows down. It gives you the best phone using experience. Go for it, if you can buy it. Don&apos;t buy Samsung products or OnePlus products they are just useless. Just go for the product.&quot;</bucket>

            <map to='#f28e2b'>
              <bucket>&quot;Itƒ??s a great phone. Cut some stars as the camera developed a problem after only 6 weeks. But Apple has fixed it. But it was unexpected and Apple and the seller must ensure that these things donƒ??t happen&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This is my first apple product purchase, prior my mentality regarding the apple product was like a no Value for money company, but once I started using this phone the premium fell and the Sooth buttery flow type interface is way better than android. Happy to use this phone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I have been an apple patron for a while.. I Started using the Iphone 3, 5, 6, 7 and now i bought the XR.. I honestly feel that its terrible.. Just a hype build around it.. The Face ID never works, the camera gets stuck on its portrait mode.. My honest feedback is not to but the iPhones anymore. Just will have to say that Apple lost itself a good customer..&quot;</bucket>
            </map>
            <map to='#fabfd2'>
              <bucket>&quot;I have received this product with manufacturing defect in it. Screen has LED bleeding problem. Contacted the service team of Apple and they are ready to replace.&quot;</bucket>
            </map>
            <map to='#fabfd2'>
              <bucket>&quot;I like everything about this product. I ordered this iphone xr on end of festive sale and Amazon delivered the product in the given time period. Everything in this phone works good and fine , no doubts. Amazon gives 100\% product to us, they never unsatisfied me. At the end Product&apos;s performance outstanding . Amazon delivery also secure????.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max. These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you wonƒ??t even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it canƒ??t click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits).&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;One of the best iPhone ever. Features are fabulous and battery life is excellent. On an average it lasts up to 10 hrs if you are an extensive phone user. This includes data usage and voice calling.  Bit heavy I comparison to other iPhones or android phones but might be thatƒ??s the trick itƒ??s good on battery life. Iƒ??ll give 10/10&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The product was just as good as an apple always is and the delivery was prompt. I am an apple user and I require all my gadgets to be in sync which is why I bought this.

              <bucket>&quot;This Appario seem to be a fraud. My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features. Even iPhone package back label have been tampered. Amazon Customer Care on phone or Twitter is of no help. I need to return this and get a replacement.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This is my third iPhone and I must say - each time Apple introduces an iPhone, they improve a lot in each model. iPhone XR is one of best selling iPhone for year 2018. Its not that cheap but still standout in crowd. Its not expensive than iPhone XS but still have all the features same as other top models- only difference is OLED screen but I can live with that. Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.  Camera is more than average and very much improved as compared to previous generations. Glass frame back and front and very appealing to eyes. Overall, a satisfactory experience with this device. A must buy if are considering iPhone 11 but have low budget.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This phone is good , i got it at Rs.45000 during this diwali sale, but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects : considering the Ram and ROM ( 3 GB and 64 GB ) in this case , is the price ok , i felt that its really overpriced, we can get more features in Phones like Redmi Note 8 pro which is priced at around 16K ( discounts and bank offer are separate) this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to Apple. Then why we are not going for One plus models made in china as Apple i phone is also made in china for your information.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Everything on this XR works extremely well but the only problem that i have faced is that there is some kind of manufacturing defect in the camera lens.The photos shot have a black spot kind of smoky.Its only visible when something bright like sky or white wall is shot.Also,Iƒ??ve wiped the camera glass many times so itƒ??s not on the camera but the inside lens.Guys,phone is quite good just be careful while purchasing can happen with anyone.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Good phone. Being a 1st time user of ios, i liked it a lot. Although the compromises made for this phone like inferior display, big bezels nd notch are cleary visible and annoying. Battery life is top notch although supplied 5 watt charger is a trash. Using my iPad charger to charge it fast. Camera gives dslr quality pics in daylight nd outdoors but night photos are below average. In total a good package to try out apple ecosystem.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I purchased this phone from amazon during the freedom sale got it for an effective price 49k . This is my first iphone and honestly not regretting a bit . I was worried about the specs such as LCD screen and camera quality but it did not disappoint me this one camera on XR is 1000 times better than those Three cameras on my samsung A50 and the LCD screen hardly makes a difference its crystal clear and vibrant . The battery life is just beautiful it can stand for 48hours on a single charge . Overall it a good buy , Apple is never great with specs but the always kills it&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This is best iPhone ever. Amazing camera quality and as usual the speed of Apple is unprecedented. Battery life is superb and It can go on without charging for 1 and half day with moderate Internet use.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This is my first iPhone. Iƒ??m happy with the performance of XR. With hdfc credit card discount and exchange of old phone, it costed me 49.7k. Both front and rear Camera quality is great, battery lasts whole day with normal use. Face recognition is better than OnePlus 6T. XRƒ??s almost HD display  can give tough competition to major FHD phones, side by side you wonƒ??t be able to spot any difference. Display is so crisp, no eye strain. And ios is buttery smooth. XR is more value for money than XS or X&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;This rating is only for the product not for  Delivery.  Till the last minute I was kept on my toes. The box was not completely in a sealed condition. Can Amazon answer for this? Coming to  Handset, No issues at all. It is simply amazing. One should know how to use it wisely. I would update my reviews after using it for few months.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60\% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5\%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear menƒ??s size medium gloves for reference.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You wonƒ??t find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I am giving this review after few months of use of this phone. Apple never disappoints you. As i have shifted from Google phone to Apple, was bit difficult to shift from android to ios but now i am used to it. So many hidden features which u can find it out from you tube. Camera is awesome. I also learned some extra tips for photography from youtube and it is awesome. The speed of the phone never disappoints you after loading full 64gb data into the phone. Overall phone is awesome.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;I was always an iPhone user  till 8+ , then thought of changing to note 8 I loved that phone too but over the period of time I started realising there is nothing like IOS and iPhone. After using two high end androids (i keep changing phones) I witched back to iPhone and OMG I must say it has even become better it is so smooth like a butter on pan and IPhone X r is beauty, Liquid Retina is awesome and beautiful will not make you miss oled also the battery back up is woooowww .  This is the first ever phone I bought thru AMAZON I was skptical but thought of taking risk and yes Amazon delivered what they promised thru FREEDOM sale got a very good deal for 128 gb everyday I fall in love with this phone ..&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;iPhone XR is brilliant perfect value for money phone giving all the specs of latest iPhone in a reasonable price. Packs the same display, screen &amp; pixel density as iPhone 11 only difference being camera upgrade &amp; A 13 bionic processor rest almost everything is same. Excellent battery life, display in iPhone XR. The White Colour looks simple, sober &amp; classy unlike dull creamy white in XS or XS Max last year. All in all a very good phone &amp; thoroughly satisfied with it.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;M an iphone addict... my first was iphone 4, then 6 which my brother gifted me but this time i upgraded to xr with my own salary n m really happy ... specially the battery life.... and  As i dont use camera much so potrait mode is not of much use to me.. face id recognition very nice... though u dont get the feel of holding iphone as it little bit big and on bulky side as compared to my iphone 6.... rest fuctioning everything is smooth so i think its worth the purchase... and if u have iphone 6 or 7 than only go for upgrade as i did lot of research and 8 and xs and xr they almost similar except for few features....&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;The first thing you notice about XR is itƒ??s battery. Super long battery of more than 24 hours. Rest is exactly as it should be in an iPhone. Camera also needs a special mention. Great camera.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;There&apos;s no fingerprint sensor as its Iphone X series..face lock works good even in dark. Display is good fully visible in outdoors. Nice battery backup. Dual sim makes it awsome i.e one E Sim and normal one. May pay nominal fee for esim to operator. Currently only Jio and Airtel support esim..so please consider that.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Using the XR for the past 3 months and Iƒ??m completely delighted to have this model. Certainly a value for money product in the iPhone flagship category.
